## Thanks  
Thanks to Sean that give me the impressive class abour advanced binary exploitation.

## ROP0
My idea:  
checksec and only find DEP on this program.  
Put /bin/sh in buf2 and ROPchain in buf, when we need rdi, we just need to give him the address of buf2.  
  
## ROP1 
My idea:  
The buf overflow is too small for our ropchain so we need to migrate stack to other place.  
In the first buf we put our ropchain and migrate stack to it in second buffer.  

What's important is that there is also **leave** in origin program, so the padding is just 0x20!  

Another point worth caring about is that the address of **'/bin/sh\x00'** and also we need to put a clear address of it into rdi; therefore; I put it in the start of buf2!
